# Progress — trading-bot

## Works (all verified)
- [x] 10 deterministic rules, both branches tested, no short-circuit (B1–B12)
- [x] Candidate model with all fields incl. decimals + None semantics (B13)
- [x] Market regime: computed once/tick, own table, API endpoint (C1–C5)
- [x] Atomic paper engine: open/close/scale_in, decide_and_act, exits,
      PAPER_TRADING_ONLY runtime asserts (E1–E7) — double-open/double-close/
      crash-replay proven by tests
- [x] Money math with hand-computed expectations, raise-on-invalid (E5/E6)
- [x] Providers live+mock: Birdeye memepool/security, Dexscreener full
      enrichment, Jupiter decimals-aware, retry/429/counters (A1–A9)
- [x] LLM narration pre-decided verdicts + grounding validation + Ollama
      health + reflections (D1–D6); template fallback for offline runs
- [x] Knowledge base: static + ingest CLI/API + digests + budgeted context
      + bucket stats (F1–F9)
- [x] Learning loop daily stats + rejection breakdown (G1–G3)
- [x] Read-only promotion gate, 5 criteria (G4–G6)
- [x] Full API surface + WS feed broadcaster (H1–H5)
- [x] Dashboard panels incl. persistent safety banner (I1–I10; build passes)
- [x] Tests J1–J5 → **136 passing** in backend
- [x] One-click launcher verified start/stop/restart
- [x] omotrades comparison + commit-reveal verification (docs/06)
- [x] Task C: live_execution/ seven-file safety model at repo root,
      offline-tested (**48 passing**; 182 combined via root pytest.ini)
- [x] omo-mimicry rebuild in progress: exit engine + fast scan loop,
      entry gate = omo rules verbatim, old logic purged, crowd conviction
      feed (fomo.fun board) live-validated → **backend 136 / combined 184**

## Deliberately not built (per spec sequencing)
- E8/E9 partial scaling + rolling history (post-calibration)
- D7 advisory LLM layer (post-calibration)
- Commit-reveal proof mechanism (only if public real-capital track record)
- crowd_heat rule (needs a fomo-index source)

## Known issues / watch items
- Birdeye free tier: token_security 401 → security fields UNKNOWN
- Ticks take 40–90s with 20 candidates (LLM-bound); acceptable
- Regime/rule thresholds are placeholders — calibration will move them

## Status
Live calibration day 0–1. Fresh $1,000 book. App runnable via ./start.sh.
